			<p>Continuing from Project 3</p>
			<p>The theme I chose deals with the video game "Halo 4" and providing other players with vital information for missions throughout the game.<p> 
			<p>I find the story within most games is what captivates it's intended audience, and thats what keeps the player involved in continuous gameplay.<p> 
	        <p>The life of the game gains new meaning after you have understood the story and have attached yourself to it's theme.<p> 
	    	<p>I want to provide the next player with just enough vital information to not spoil the players experience,but enhance it and cause the player to feel prepared for the upcoming missions.<p>
	        <p>Javascript explanations:<p>
	        <p>Ordinance Request are custom weapon combinations that a player can choose from<p>
	        <p>Spartans are the soldiers you can play as in "Halo 4"<p>  
	        <p>Planet Requiem is the location where the game takes place<p>
	        <p>Promethean Knight is the enemy alien species<p>
